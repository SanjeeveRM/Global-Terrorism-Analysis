# Global-Terrorism-Analysis
This GitHub repository contains a PDF file that compiles all codes and inferences of Global Terrorism Analysis around the world using R language. The analysis was performed on the Global Terrorism Database, which includes over 200,000 cases of terrorist attacks from around the world from 1970-2016.

The analysis was performed using RStudio, and included exploratory analysis to derive insights on the correlation of terrorism with location, by terrorist group, population, and occurrences of terrorism. The analysis also included time-series forecasting for future occurrences of terrorism in terms of attack frequency and number of casualties, as well as ANOVA for the link between weapon type, target type, and group.
